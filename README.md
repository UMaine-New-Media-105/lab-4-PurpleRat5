Lab 4 of the NMD 105 course, This lab uses functions some more and demonstrates the ability to pass variables through a function.

The first task is to make 3 functions in order to draw a trianlge, a rectangle, and another shape (In my case a hexagon)
The second task is to add a color by passing it thru our function, this can be done easily using fill()
The third task is to make 2 avatars which will appear conditionally based on a mouse press, I made a human and a wolf.
